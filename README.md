# Dates:  
2013 - 2014  
# Technologies:  
Cloud9, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, AJAX, jQuery, Twitter API, Instagram API, Google Maps API  
# Description:  
This final project uses 3 different APIs (Twitter, Instagram, Google Maps) to search for given terms on both Twitter and Instagram simultaneously and maps them on Google Maps if a location is present in any of the results.  

This is a group project consisting of 4 members.  I was in charge of designing and building the front end user interface and overall layout of the page.  I also worked on creating the code which calls and creates the modal windows throughout the project.  These modal windows are triggered whenever the username on the results list is clicked and on the Google map markers.  I also coded the functionality of the Google mini map markers that are next to each formatted address in the results in both Twitter and Instagram boxes.  

The project was created with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, AJAX, jQuery, Twitter API, Instagram API, Google Maps API in [Cloud9 - https://c9.io](https://c9.io/).
